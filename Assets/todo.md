# TODO
- navigate rooms by walking through them (player camera / character)
- doors sometimes generated on very thin walls
- doors sometimes generated at 0,0 location?
- Remove rooms that are x depth behind current room
- when going in next room and returning back -> show previous room again / new room -> OPTION
- (wall on which door is can be lost in creation of bigRoom when at this wall new room is added) should be fixed but not sure
- doors can be half width or something and have weird mesh around them
- rooms some depth in can be just 1 wall from door to 0,0 point?
