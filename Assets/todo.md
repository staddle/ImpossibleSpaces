# TODO
- doors sometimes generated at 0,0 location?
- Remove rooms that are x depth behind current room - do i want this?
- when going in next room and returning back -> show previous room again / new room -> OPTION
- (wall on which door is can be lost in creation of bigRoom when at this wall new room is added) should be fixed but not sure
- rooms some depth in can be just 1 wall from door to 0,0 point?
- Can room be bigger than maximumGeneralLayoutRoomSize (createRandomGeneralLayoutRoom in LayoutCreator)
- Allow multiple doors per segment?
- still some rooms cannot generate another door even though enough room is on at least 1 wall (most of the time these rooms are at the edge of the playarea)
