# TODO
- navigate rooms by walking through them (player camera / character)
- doors sometimes generated on very thin walls
- doors sometimes generated at 0,0 location?
- some rooms have walls going through the room?
- generate doors only when enough room is left afterwards to walk in nextRhythmDirection (parameter?)
- Remove rooms that are x depth behind current room
- when going in next room and returning back -> show previous room again / new room -> OPTION
